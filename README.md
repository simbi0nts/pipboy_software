Pipboy software for running on Banana Pro

Without music (you have to manually upload audio files to /sounds/radio/* folders). Can be running on UNIX-systems only. GPIO and network access required.

Note: it's an unofficial fork from https://github.com/grieve/pypboy
I'd just added some stuff like radio animation and additional screens
